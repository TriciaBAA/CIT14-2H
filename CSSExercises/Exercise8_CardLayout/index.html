            <p>“About You” is the penultimate song included in The 1975’s fifth studio album Being Funny in a Foreign Language.

                The song is a musical continuation of the band’s 2013 single “Robbers”, opting for a gothic piece with a huge hall reverb. Collaborating with Warren Ellis, (who is best known as the violinist for the Australian post-rock band Dirty Three and as well as the frequent collaborator of singer-songwriter Nick Cave) the strings and major key creates an orchestral yet grounded musical arrangement.
                
                It features a duet with Carly Holt, the wife of The 1975’s lead guitarist Adam Hann. Prior to its release, Pitchfork described the song as “moody”, comparing Healy’s vocals to Morrissey.</p>
